**Significance of Zero flag and Carry flag in conditional jumps.**


The Zero flag (ZF) is set when a result is zero, often used in conditional jumps for equality checks.
The Carry flag (CF) indicates carry-out or borrow, crucial in conditional jumps, especially for multi-byte arithmetic operations.
In short, flags help control program flow by allowing the CPU to make decisions based on operation results.
